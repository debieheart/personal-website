            <h2>Just call me Debie!</h2> 
            <p><span>Fullname:</span> Debie Heart Garzon Belinario<br>
               <span>Age:</span> 20<br>
               <span>Birthdate:</span> June 20, 2004<br>
              <span>Home Address:</span>  Tungawan, Tambulig, Zamboanga del Sur<br>
               <span>No. Siblings:</span> 2 
               <br>
               I am the only female and the eldest among of my siblings. 
            </p>
            <p>I am a passionate and dedicated student currently pursuing Bachelor of Science in Information Technology at Northwestern Mindanao State College of Science and Technology. I'm committed to being a student-athlete who can successfully balance athletics and academics, fostering my growth and development.<br>
                <br>
                I’m optimistic and caring. I always try to see the bright side of things and understand how others feel. I love being creative and coming up with new ideas, and I’m always there for my friends and family.

                However, I’m still learning and growing. Sometimes, it takes me a while to understand new things, especially when it comes to math problems with words. I also get nervous when I have to talk in front of a group of people, and sometimes I struggle to find the right words to express myself.</p>
